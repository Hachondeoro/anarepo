        description: "She is from Argentina and has been in Australia since 2012. With a background in Political Science, she studied Education at Charles Darwin University and since graduating, she has been teaching and connecting with dozens of students from all around the world. \n\n Ana is currently working at STEPS AMEP and Training where she teaches foundation English language and settlement skills to migrants and refugees. \n\n She loves her job because her true passion is to connect with people, especially international students and migrants, inspire them and provide them with a supportive and enabling environment to reach their full potential.She truly believes education is the key for change. \n\n Ana also works as a Spanish interpreter for the Northern Territory Government and the Australian Department of Home Affairs and has recently started her own translation business.\n\n Before coming to Australia, she volunteered at the National Congress and different governmental organisations in Argentina and for an NGO in Germany and Morocco that aimed to improve the quality of life of women through education.\n\n She loves road trips, spy movies and steak(can you name an Argentine who doesn't? ðŸ˜›) and oddly enough, she used to be terrified of speaking in public. Becoming a teacher left her with no other choice so one of her favourite quotes now is: 'The best way out is always through'. She would like you to always remember that the journey towards achieving your dreams is a life-changing process."
